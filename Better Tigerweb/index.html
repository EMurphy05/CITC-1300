  <h1>Tired of Tigerweb being so complicated?</h1>
  <h2>Heres a guide!</h2>
<hr>
   <p>Tigerweb, the official website for chattanooga state community college, is notorious for being not so user friendly. The site is hard to navigate, to the point where most students cannot find their class schedules without someone elses helping to show them how. The site is also outdated, with most pages being basic text links with no style or formatting, and many linked pages that no longer exist, are not actually used for what they say they do, or just have not been updated in a very long time.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://blss.chattanoogastate.edu/prod_ssb/twbkwbis.P_GenMenu?name=bmenu.P_MainMnu">Tigerweb Self-service</a></h3>
    <p>The Self-Service tab holds most of the more important information and tools you will be using in Tigerweb, but it is quite complicated to navigate. To access your <mark>schedule, class registration, financial standings, personal information, or pay your tuition,</mark> go to Self-Service in yout Tigerweb. Student records and administration are under the "Student" link. Your class schedule is also in there under the "Registration" link, and then "Week at a Glance" </p>

      <h3><a href="https://degreeworks.chattanoogastate.edu:9904/RespDashboard/">Tiger Tracks</a></h3>
 <p>Tiger Tracks goes to a third party site called Degreeworks, so it is much easier to navigate, but this is where you can see your <mark>A number, current GPA, and degree information.</mark></p>

   <h3><a href="https://tigerpedia.chattanoogastate.edu/">Tigerpedia</a></h3>
<p>Okay so the Tigerpedia is not on Tigerweb as far as I know, but I really think it should be, as it is a great <mark>source for acidemic, navigation, and general questions.</mark>This site has guides to almost every question like how to use student reasorces and connect to the internet. here is a list of some of the most helpful guides I have found.</p>
