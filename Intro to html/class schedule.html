        <h3>How to Figure out Locations</h3>
            <p>You should now be looking at a pretty confusing mess of blue text on a calender that breaks down the days of a week, unless you have yet to start your school week. You will have to navigate to the week classes start if you are viewing the schedule in advance. To understand what times your classes are and which building and room they will be in, focus on one block of blue text at a time and focus on the bottoms. At the very bottom of every blue block of text will be some capital letters, like OMN, HUM, IMC, or TCAT. Those letters are the abbreviations of the buildings your classes will be in. They all have them and you should be abele to find a map that lists them all. Next to those letters are the room number you will be looking for. When classes first start, there are usually staff members standing by the floor maps that all buildings have. they can easily give you directions if you see them.</p>

        <h3>How to Figure out Times</h3>
            <p>Above the building and room number information, you should see times listed, like "8:00am - 9:00am" for example. These are your class times. Each block of text is one class, and classes can and will repeat during the week, and show on your schedule. The remaining text is usually not as useful, just the identifying name of the class and the type of class. If you need more info like what class it is or who your professor will be, you can click the blue text and it will take you to a more in depth overview of that specific class. If you have questions about the class, you should email your advisor or the professor. The professors email info should be in that in depth view of the class.</p>
