  <h1>Tired of Tigerweb being so complicated?</h1>
  <h2>Heres a guide!</h2>
<hr>

   <p>On this page, if you scroll down, there are links to every important aspect of Tigerweb, and basic descriptions of what they are used for. In the navigation section are detailed guides for finding certian information or completing certian actions with Tigerweb. In theory, if I had access to the college servers, I would directly improve the web itself, but because I cannot do that, creating guides to hopefully help those who find the website just as overwhelming and confusing as I did is the next best thing. If you know how to acomplish something in a easier way than described on this website, please reach out. If you need help with something Tigerweb related and can't find it here immediatly, please reach out. If you have suggestions for guides or instructions that I have yet to list, please reach out.</p>

    <p>The Self-Service tab holds most of the more important information and tools you will be using in Tigerweb, but it is quite complicated to navigate. Here you can find your class schedule, regestration information, financial aid information, personal information, and much more. </p>

      <h3><a href="https://degreeworks.chattanoogastate.edu:9904/RespDashboard/" target="_blank">Tiger Tracks</a></h3>

 <p>Tiger Tracks goes to a third party site called Degreeworks, so it is much easier to navigate, but this is where you can see your A number, current GPA, and degree information.</p>

   <h3><a href="https://tigerpedia.chattanoogastate.edu/" target="_blank">Tigerpedia</a></h3>

<p>Okay so the Tigerpedia is not on Tigerweb as far as I know, but I really think it should be, as it is a great source for acidemic, navigation, and general questions. This site has guides to almost every question like how to use student reasorces and connect to the internet. here is a list of some of the most helpful guides I have found.</p>

   <p>Creating this guide aims to help students and community members easily navigate the often cumbersome and outdated website of our local community college. The ultimate goal is to bridge the gap between users and essential resources, ensuring everyone can efficiently access the information they need. By highlighting the current challenges and providing practical solutions, I hope to raise awareness about the need for improvements. It is my sincere desire that this guide not only empowers users but also serves as a catalyst for the college to prioritize website enhancements. A more user-friendly and updated website will foster a better educational experience and community engagement. Let this guide be a testament to the power of collective effort and constructive feedback. Together, we can inspire positive change for a brighter future.</p>
